# Econometrics
This project focuses on the applications of univariate, single equation time series models. Using these applications, the module explains how to forecast a variable such as a stock price, stock returns, or inflation using only its own history. The projects begins by introducing AutoRegressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) models along with their properties and continues by explaining the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model, which includes both AR and MA components. At the end of the project the Box-Jenkins method is applied to ARMA/ARIMA models to determine which univariate series model best fits a given econometric problem.
